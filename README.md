ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION PROJECT OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS

Given tasks are done in FORTRAN.

IDE Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 is used to develop this project. Solution consists of the following:

FORTRAN_Project – as Console Application

The project was completed with the documentation (pdf file) covering theoretical basics on which the task in the project is based. The documentation contains an attachment with the input data presented in external files, also. The implementation of the program itself involves the implementation of most a feature of Fortran programming language.

THE TASK IN SHORT:
The program provides electrical installation calculations of residential building consisting of eight identical one-room flats and power line for supplying ten suh identical buildings. The mutual position of the buildings and the power transformer station is given in the Figure 1.1. The architectural plan of one of them is shown in the Figure 1.2. The project must comply with the unique requirements for the design of electrical installations in residential buildings, in accordance with the applicable technical regulations. Covers technical requirements of adopted solutions, verification of the derived protection system, and AutoCAD graphic documentation.

Also, this project contains the necessary graphic documentation created in AutoCAD software (folder “Plans”).
